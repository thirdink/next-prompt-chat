# Project Name
Promt lib - A Prompt Library for Language Learning Models

## Overview

This project is a library for storing user-generated prompts that can be used to initialize chats with Language Learning Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, using GPT-4. It is built with React and TypeScript, and utilizes Supabase for backend services. The application provides a platform for users to create, store, and manage prompts that can be used to facilitate engaging and dynamic conversations with AI models.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login functionality.
- **Prompt Library**: Users can create, store, and manage their own prompts.
- **LLM Integration**: The prompts can be used to initialize chats with LLMs like ChatGPT, using GPT-4.
- **Real-Time Interactions**: Users can see the AI responses in real-time.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/thirdink/prompt-lib.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env.local` and populate it with values from your Supabase project's API Settings and open AI's API key.
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

## Usage

After starting the development server, visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the application. You can register a new account, or log in if you already have one. Once logged in, you can start creating and managing prompts, and initialize chats with the AI models.
